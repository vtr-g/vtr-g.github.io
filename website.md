## Starting and Educating Students on Creating a Website

When it comes to education, I always lean on a portfolio-based, project style of teaching. In my CSII Class, I make sure that every student can use their protfolio created site in order to update others on the work that they are creating.

### Learning Version Control

Every student gets a free hosted website on Github, therefore I kill two birds with one stone by having them learn version control at the same time.

The best place where high schoolers learn about version control is an interactive videogame named [Oh my Git](https://ohmygit.org), graciousley offered for free by founders blinry and bleeptrack. We play through the whole course, it will be rocky anf confusing - but make sure you give them plenty of time and chances to learn the ropes of using git.

### Github and Contributions

Afterwards, each student needs to initiate their first contribution. I like [first-contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) for this.

Then we go straight into creating our own websites together!

### Update 1

#### Landing Page Woes
The landing page is ugly, I need to figure out how to add links and images to the left side of the website. 

Here's what it looks like now:

It looks like HTML, so I probably just need to do a deep dive into the ```_layouts/default.html``` file.

#### Datatables
I'd like to learn how to have projects be automatically updated with a "last updated" date. I may need to look into some alternative ways of using datatables on websites. Right now, the home page is powered by JQuery tables, and I am not sure if I should be using something more complex, perhaps a SQL database? TBD.
